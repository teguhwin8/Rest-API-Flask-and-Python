# Python on Mac

Hey, welcome to "Python on Mac".

To install Python, download Python 3.10 (or higher) from http://www.python.org.

Once Python is installed, you can execute the program "Terminal.app ". This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word python3.10 and that will start the Python program.

At all points during the course, you can always type python3.10 name_of_file.py and that will execute the code of a file called name_of_file.py

Kind regards,

Jose
